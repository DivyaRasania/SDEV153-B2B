            <dd>
                Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden
                floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.

            <dd>
                Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table
                and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink
                with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of
                clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
