                <dt>What is Yurts?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a
                    wooden floor,
                    a roof dome that can be opened,
                    and a private deck.
                </dd>

                <dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining
                    table and chairs,
                    mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot
                    and cold running water.
                    Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                <dt>What should I bring?</dt>
                <dd>
                    Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers
                    of clothing.
                    It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
