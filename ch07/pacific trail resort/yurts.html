                <p>
                    Our luxury yurts are permanent four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor,
                    a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.

                <h3><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining
                    table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes
                    a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                <h3><strong>What should I bring?</strong></h3>
                <p>
                    Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers
                    of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
