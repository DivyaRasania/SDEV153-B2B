                    <h3>What is a yurt?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the
                        ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome
                        that can be opened, and a private deck.
                    </p>

                    <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with
                        down quilt, comfy couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge,
                        microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience
                        includes a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and
                        restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

                    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for
                        changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful
                        to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
